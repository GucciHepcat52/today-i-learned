# Introduction to Linked Lists

In computer programming, a linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size, and elements can be dynamically added or removed.

A basic unit of a linked list is a "node", and each node contains two components:

- **Data**
  - This is the actual value or information stored in the node.
- **Pointer (or reference)**
  - This points to the next node in the sequence.

The last node in the list typically has a pointer that points to null, indicating the end of the list.

## Difference Types of Linked Lists

- **_Singly Linked List_**

  - Each node points to the next node in the sequence.

- **_Doubly Linked List_**

  - Each node has pointers to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence.

- **_Circular Linked List_**

  - The last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a closed loop.

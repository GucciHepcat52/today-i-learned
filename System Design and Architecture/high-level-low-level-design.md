# High-Level and Low-Level Design

Both of these stages in the design process are crucial in the software development life cycle, as they help ensure a systematic and organized approach to building complext software systems.

## Differences

- **_High-Level Design (HLD)_**

  - **Scope**
    - HLD is a conceptual and abstract representation of the entire system.
    - It focuses on the system as a whole and identifies the main components or modules and their relationships.
  - **Abstraction**
    - It abstracts the details of individual components and concentrates on how they interact with each other.
  - **Decisions**
    - HLD involves making decisions about the architecture of the system, such as the choice of technologies, major components, and their interactions.
  - **Documentation**
    - The output of HLD is often in the form of diagrams, charts, or other visual representations that illustrate the structure and relationships within the system.

- **_Low-Level Design (LLD)_**

  - **Scope**
    - LLD deals with the detailed design of each module identified in the high-level design.
    - It focuses on the implementation of individual components and their internal workings.
  - **Abstraction**
    - LLD involves a more detailed and concrete representation of the system. It includes data structures, algorithms, and specific details about how each module functions.
  - **Decisions**
    - LLD involves decisisons related to data structures, algorithms, and interfaces. It may also include specifics about error handling, security mechanisms, and performance considerations.
  - **Documentation**
    - LLD is typically documented in the form of flowcharts, data structures, pseudo code, or other detailed representations that guide the actual coding process.

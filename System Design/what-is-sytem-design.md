# System Design

A phase in the software developlment life cycle (SDLC) that involves the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

The goal of system design is to create a blueprint for the construction of the system. This blueprint includes technical specifications that guide the development team in building the software or system.

## Design Patterns

> Note: A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

- **_Architectural Design_**

  - This involves defining the overall structure of the system, including its components and their relationships. It addresses issues such as the organization of the system, the distribution of functionality among components, and the communication between them.

- **_High-Level Design_**

  - In this phase, the systems's major components and their interactions are defined in more detail. This includes designing data structures, algorithms, and interfaces. It may also involve selecting appropriate technologies and platforms.

- **_Detailed Design_**

  - This phase goes further into the details of each component or module. It involves specifying the data structures, algorithms, and data flow for each module. Detailed design provides a comprehensive view of how each component will be implemented.

- **_Interface Design_**

  - Designing the interfaces between different system components is critical for ensuring proper communication and coordination. This includes defining input and output formats, protocols, and data exchange mechanisms.

- **_Database Design_**

  - If the system involves a database, the design phase includes defining the structure of the database, tables, relationships, and constraints. It also involves specifying how data will be stored, retrieved, and updated.

- **_Security Design_**

  - Ensuring the security of the system is a crucial aspect of system design. This involves defining measures to protect data, authenticate users, and control access to the system.

- **_User Interface Design_**
  - If the system has a user interface, this aspect involves designing the visual and interactive elements to ensure a user-friendly experience.
